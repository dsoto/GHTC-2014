# A consumer-based analysis of solar lantern financing

## first abstract draft

This paper demonstrates a framework for analyzing small distributed
resources as investments.
This paper will be of interest to the GHTC community because it blends
the technical with the financial, an area where the GHTC literature
could be improved.
This paper shows the influence of lantern cost, weather patterns, and
kerosene cost on the attractiveness of a solar lantern purchase.
This also shows that many lanterns do not payback within the first year
at the rate of avoided kerosene usage.
The internal rate of return for the lanterns is calculated in order to
compare with the available finance rates.
Solar lantern internal rates of return are very favorable over the life
of the device.
I find that the loan terms (less than a year with ~40% interest rates) lead to
monthly payments that are greater than the avoided kerosene cost.
For rapid scaling of these technologies to occur, the avoided monthly
payment must be higher than the finance cost.
My hope is that this paper will begin a conversation where technology
and financing are linked.
This can lead to the creation of business models where more value is
retained by the consumer and the energy providers rather than the
capital providers.

# Pico-power financial returns

<!--
second draft outline
- IEA shows need is 50/50 distributed and centralized
- current investment leans centralized
- private and consumer investment must do for near term
- what then is the feasibility of private finance for pico power?
- i outline the return on investment for a household of several possible
  pico power options
- i then compare these to currently available microfinance rates
- for many investments, there is not a loan option that results in a
  reduction in expenditures
- without this reduction in expenditures, widespread adoption without
  subsidy is less likely
- to foster scaling of pico-power technologies, financial innovation is
  necessary since technical innovation cannot make up problem
-->

1.3 Billion people will remain without electricity without significant
investment in new energy services.  The IEA shows that about half of
these services need to be distributed energy to reach those beyond the
grid.  Current investment focuses on centralized power plants and
grid expansion.  In the absence of public funding, the unelectrified
rural populations must rely on private financing.  In this paper, I
compare the financial returns from pico-power consumer products
and the available financing for consumers from microfinancing.
For many investments, there is not a technical and financial option that
allows consumers to reduce their energy expenditures.
A comparison of the avoided cost in kerosene or phone charging and the
monthly payment for a product shows that microfinance loan payments
often exceed the avoided cost.
Many customers are not able to tolerate these higher recurring
payments even though in the future they will have no payments.
In the developed
world, innovators create instruments that eliminate upfront costs for
energy services and
immediately reduce consumer energy expenses.  Equivalent innovation in this
space could speed adoption of these technologies in the developing world
as well.
