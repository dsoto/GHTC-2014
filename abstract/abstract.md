1.3 Billion people will remain without electricity without significant
investment in new energy services.  The IEA shows that about half of
these services need to be distributed energy to reach those beyond the
grid.  Current investment focuses on centralized power plants and grid
expansion.  In the absence of public funding, the unelectrified rural
populations must rely on private financing.  In this paper, I compare
the financial returns from watt-scale consumer products for lighting and
mobile phone charging and the available financing for consumers from
microfinancing.  A comparison of the avoided cost in kerosene or phone
charging and the monthly payment for a product shows that microfinance
loan payments often exceed the avoided cost.  Many customers are not
able to tolerate these higher recurring payments even though in the
future they will have no payments.  In the developed world, innovators
create instruments that eliminate upfront costs for energy services and
immediately reduce consumer energy expenses.  Equivalent innovation in
this space could speed adoption of these technologies in the developing
world as well.
