## Introduction

### Big picture
- Assume private financing
- Assume customers have little ability to save

### Literature review
- Lighting Africa mentions simple payback
- Arc Finance shows case studies

### My approach
- I will integrate and generalize

## Methodology

### Review financial metrics
- Simple payback
- NPV
- IRR

### Energy products as investments
- Demonstrate energy as investment

## Results

### Solar lantern
- Assumptions
- Results

### Solar home system
- Assumptions
- Results

## Discussion

## Conclusion


<!--
## Impact
- How will this paper change our field?
- How will this paper increase energy access?
- Who should read this to increase energy access?


## Introduction
- despite high growth rate, uneven access to poor
- lack of financial modeling of off-grid solutions
- IEA says 50% of power needs to be off grid
- large scale capital like power africa currently flowing to centralized
  solutions.  private sector will have to step in.
- these off grid solutions will require small financing
- financing and returns need to be matched
- US solar adoption appears to be driven by financial innovations
  allowing for no-money down solar
- even attractive payback periods may not be acceptable due to lack of
  liquid capital
- providing a methodology for analysis
- methodology allows for the quantification of necessary finance rates
- investments that make sense from NPV perspective may be unattractive
  from IRR perspective

- current energy solutions in the off-grid space offer low initial costs
  but burden the consumer with high recurring costs

## Introduction explain NPV, payback time, IRR
- net income as fraction of total income

## Contributions
- IRR methodology
- IRR from consumer perspective
    - for picosolar lighting (assume battery, panel, assembly costs)
    - phone charging
    - battery rental
    - of BBOXX or ReadySet
- IRR from business perspective
    - battery rental
- comparison of IRRs and available finance rates

## classes of devices analyzed
- Solar lantern
- Solar phone charger
- Battery rental system

## Calculations
- notebooks/lantern-finance.ipynb

## survey of available finance rates

## Methodology
- assumptions
    - led, battery, kerosene, charging costs
    - constant linear bank
- we plot the IRR of different options and compare to finance rates
- we make available example code and methods for replication as the
  market evolves and costs change


## Figures
- range of irr with lantern cost and kerosene displacements
- net present value of lantern investments as a function of discount
  rate?
- figure that demonstrates quartiles of income and purchasing power
- map space of available loan terms


## Results
- which investments result in net increase in income


## Discussion
- Financing is not available over the lifetime of the battery
- Per unit of service costs are very high compared to grid
- We should look for alternatives to consumer financing
- Transactions costs must be lowered
- We can think (as EEs) of these transaction costs as line losses or
  efficiency reductions
