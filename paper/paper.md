    1.3 Billion people will remain without electricity without significant
    investment in new energy services.  The IEA shows that about half of
    these services need to be distributed energy to reach those beyond the
    grid.  Current investment focuses on centralized power plants and grid
    expansion.  In the absence of public funding, the unelectrified rural
    populations must rely on private financing.  In this paper, I compare
    the financial returns from watt-scale consumer products for lighting and
    mobile phone charging and the available financing for consumers from
    microfinancing.  A comparison of the avoided cost in kerosene or phone
    charging and the monthly payment for a product shows that microfinance
    loan payments often exceed the avoided cost.  Many customers are not
    able to tolerate these higher recurring payments even though in the
    future they will have no payments.  In the developed world, innovators
    create instruments that eliminate upfront costs for energy services and
    immediately reduce consumer energy expenses.  Equivalent innovation in
    this space could speed adoption of these technologies in the developing
    world as well.

# Introduction
- a citation occurs [@MVPEnergy]

## Big picture
- Assume private financing
- Assume customers have little ability to save

## Literature review
- Lighting Africa mentions simple payback
- Arc Finance shows case studies
- Lighting africa literature on avoided kerosene
- Nathan Johnson avoided firewood use
- Schnitzer mini-grid tariff stuff
- SS data suggests small regular payments possible

## My approach
- I will integrate and generalize
- I'll describe different financial decision criteria

# Methodology

## Review financial metrics
- Simple payback
- NPV
- IRR
- Demonstrate difficulty of saving
    - extend lighting africa by looking at percentage of income
- Net avoided energy expenditure
    - as percentage of energy
    - as percentage of income
- Energy and energy efficiency decisions in the US follow similar logic

## Quantify costs and benefits
- Monthly/daily financing
- Avoided kerosene costs
    - Show costs in terms of ml of kerosene displaced
- Revenue generation

## Energy products as investments
- Demonstrate energy as investment
- What are the customer returns?
    - cite benefits from lighting africa surveys

# Results
- consider from both business and customer perspective?

## Solar lantern
- Assumptions
- Results

## Solar home system
- Assumptions
- Results

## Battery charging system
- Assumptions
- Results

# Discussion
<!-- this can be very thin for first draft, focus on calculations -->

## Introduction
- Central point is that lowest initial cost is not always desirable
- These same issues come up in diesel mini-grids

## Social
## Technical

## Financial
- Lower tiers are possible through financing
- Upper tiers are more difficult
- For example refrigerators require large marginal benefit
- Companies are pursuing this pay-as-you-go model
- For highest affordability, financing should be extended over the life
  of the product

## Economic
- Only certain conditions result in net energy expenditure reduction

## Design
- How do we move to higher tiers of energy access while simultaneously
  making it available to more income levels

## Loan transaction costs
- MFI rates
- Mobile money rates and remittance transaction costs #africasupertax

## Higher initial costs could lead to lower recurring costs
- Obvious with solar
- Longer more expensive batteries also have this feature
    - cite soto ghtc 2012

## Need to incorporate this into design process
- How can reduction of transaction costs be incorporated into design
  process?


## Difficulty once avoided costs are gone
- Productive uses will need to create income streams rather than
  displace costs, making returns more uncertain

## Need for research to quantify assumptions
- There is a need to quantify and publish these costs and benefits


# Conclusion
- Products should be designed simultaneously with business models
- Can we include financial engineering in our designs?

## Impact
- How will this paper change our field?
    - by creating greater awareness of recurring cost issues
- How will this paper increase energy access?
- Who should read this to increase energy access?

## Introduction
- despite high growth rate, uneven access to poor
- lack of financial modeling of off-grid solutions
- IEA says 50% of power needs to be off grid
- large scale capital like power africa currently flowing to centralized
  solutions.  private sector will have to step in.
- these off grid solutions will require small financing

## Introduction explain NPV, payback time, IRR
- net income as fraction of total income

## Figures
- range of irr with lantern cost and kerosene displacements
- net present value of lantern investments as a function of discount
  rate?
- figure that demonstrates quartiles of income and purchasing power
- map space of available loan terms

## Discussion
- Financing is not available over the lifetime of the battery
- Per unit of service costs are very high compared to grid
- We should look for alternatives to consumer financing
- Transactions costs must be lowered
- We can think (as EEs) of these transaction costs as line losses or
  efficiency reductions
